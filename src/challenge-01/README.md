# ðŸ‘¹ **Code possession**

Regan has been possessed and now speaks in a strange language ðŸ˜±. Father Karras has discovered that when Regan is possessed, **she completely reverses the words she says**, but keeps the order of the phrases.

Your mission is to create a program that translates Regan's possessed messages into normal human language.

For example:

```ts
const message = "i yojne gnihctaw uoy";
translatePossessed(message); // "i enjoy watching you"
```

The spaces between words must be preserved:

```ts
const message = "siht si gnorw";
translatePossessed(message); // "this is wrong"
```

If the message is empty or contains only spaces, return an empty string:

```ts
const message = "      ";
translatePossessed(message); // ""
```

Words may contain uppercase and lowercase letters, and they should be preserved:

```ts
const message = "dooG secitcarP";
translatePossessed(message); // "Good Practices"
```
