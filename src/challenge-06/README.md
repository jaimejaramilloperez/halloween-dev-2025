# 🤡 **The chaos**

**Art the Clown** 🤡 has captured some victims and seated them in a circle 🎪, numbered from **`0` to `N-1`**, where N is the number of victims.

**Art**, being a methodical clown in his madness, decides to play a "game". He starts at position 0 and counts **K victims clockwise** (including the current person in the count). The victim where the count ends is eliminated from the circle.

Then, **Art** continues counting K positions from the next living person. The process repeats until only one person remains.

In his twisted mind, Art wants to know: **Who will be the last survivor?**

Implement the function `surviveRoulette(victims, count)` that returns the position of the last victim to survive.

The input parameters are:

- `victims`: Total number of victims (seated in positions 0 to n-1)
- `count`: Number to count to eliminate the next victim

#### 📝 Examples

```ts
surviveRoulette(4, 2);
// Result: 0

// Explanation:
// Start with 4 victims: [0, 1, 2, 3]
// Count 2 from position 0: eliminates 1 → [0, 2, 3]
// Count 2 from last victim: eliminates 3 → [0, 2]
// Count 2 from last victim: eliminates 2 → [0]
// Survivor: 0

surviveRoulette(5, 3);
// Result: 3

// Explanation:
// Start with 5 victims: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
// Count 3 from 0: eliminates 2 → [0, 1, 3, 4]
// Count 3 from 3: eliminates 0 → [1, 3, 4]
// Count 3 from 1: eliminates 4 → [1, 3]
// Count 3 from 1: eliminates 1 → [3]
// Survivor: 3

surviveRoulette(5, 10);
// Result: 3

// Explanation:
// Start with 5 victims: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
// Count 10 from 0: eliminates 4 → [0, 1, 2, 3]
// Count 10 from 0: eliminates 2 → [0, 1, 3]
// Count 10 from 0: eliminates 0 → [1, 3]
// Count 10 from 1: eliminates 1 → [3]
// Survivor: 3
```

**Note:** This is a classic problem known as the "Josephus Problem". You must find an efficient solution, as `count` can be very large.
